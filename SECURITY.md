## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please message me directly or shoot me an email @ safethishome@gmail.com

Whether this app gets published in the Play Store remains to be seen, but the latest version will always be available for download here. 
Once a security issue is confirmed, I will post a notice here, which will identify the vulnerability and establish a tenative timeline for
a fix. If you are subscribed to notifications, it should push out to all associated emails. Research on a fix will begin immediately, and 
a follow-up post will indicate when a new version is available for download. 

I am currently a one-man team so any assistance is welcome. Code on!
